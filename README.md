# âŒš BellaBeat Case Study | Google Capstone Project 

The goal of this project is to provide answers to a set of business questions and to study secondary consumer data to identify growth opportunities and gain insights into smart device usage for Bellabeat, a small, high-tech manufacturer company that provides health-focused products for women. Bellabeat aims to establish an effective footprint in the global smart device market. Specifically, the project focuses on aligning findings with business objectives and presenting them to the Bellabeat marketing executive team, along with high-level recommendations. The project also aims to identify consumers using non-Bellabeat smart devices for benchmarking purposes, allowing the company to compare strategies and features. The final deliverable will recommend cost-effective strategies based on the analysis of features, cost, and usage of identified smart devices.
